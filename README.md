## About

Welcome to the React State Management Lab, where you'll dive into the exciting world of stateful component interactions in React. In this lab, you're tasked with assembling and managing a team to survive the looming zombie apocalypse. Your mission: to strategically assemble and manage a team of diverse characters, each with unique attributes and costs.

By adding and removing team members, tracking resources, and calculating team stats, you'll gain hands-on experience with React's state management and dynamic UI updates. This interactive simulation is not just about surviving an apocalypse; it’s a practical adventure into understanding and mastering the core concepts of React state.
