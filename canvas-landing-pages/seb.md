In this lab, you're tasked with assembling a team to survive the looming zombie apocalypse. Your mission: to strategically manage a team of diverse characters, each with unique skills and costs.

This interactive simulation is not just about surviving an apocalypse; itâ€™s a practical adventure into understanding and mastering the core concepts of React state.
